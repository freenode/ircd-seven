ircd-seven has been developed to meet the policy needs of the
freenode IRC network. The ircd is based closely on Charybdis
(http://www.ircd-charybdis.net/) which in turn is an evolution
from ircd-ratbox. Charybdis has a dedicated, large and active
development team with whom we have worked closely throughout
the development of ircd-seven.

ircd-seven development is currently led by Stephen Bennett
(spb, stephen -at- freenode.net)
